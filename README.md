<h1> AC 230V light dimmer </h1>
<p> The aim of this repository is to introduce my latest "project" for a job interview.  <br>

<h2> Functionality </h2>
<p> 
This device can dim the lights according to the position of the potentiometer. It can be also controlled remotely via Wifi with help of mobile app.</p>
<p> The dimmer function is based on the Leading Edge Triac method. The brain of this device is ESP8266 microcontroller, which ensures all timings and connectivity. </p>
<h3> Sheme and layout </h3>
<p> Scheme and PCB layout were created in EasyEDA environment, mainly because it is a relatively simple project, and because I have ordered components together with PCB at JLCPCB. For more complex projects I'm able to work with Solidworks PCB (it is similar to Altium, but for me, it has better connectivity with SOLIDWORKS, which I use for 3D printed casings. <p><br>

<h3>Some random test, to prove, that i can use scope</h3>

<h3>Casing</h3>
<p>Casing was designed in SOLIDWORKS and printed with Creality ENDER 3 Pro 3D printer.</p>

<h3> Mobile app and connectivity </h3>
<p>Users can control the device with a mobile app. This app was written in "Flutter" (this language allows to write only one code, which is suitable for android and IOS together)</p>
